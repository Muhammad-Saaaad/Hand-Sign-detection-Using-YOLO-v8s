# Hand-Sign-detection-Using-YOLO-v8s
self-made datasets of over 1170 images of 8 different hand sign

using YOLO(You Only Read Once) V8s we are predicting 8 different hand signs including (peace, ok, like, dislike, good job, call me, and bang bang).

It was a very great experience as I have been making a custom  dataset of over 1100+ images with annotations I have achieved a whole accuracy of 99.5% in my training of the Yolo model.
Hope this project will find you very interesting
